 			<p>APUA was created in 2025 by two friends, Filippo Muzi Falconi and Boris Grisot, who first met while working at Domaine de Boisbuchet, a cultural centre for art, design, and architecture in France.</p>
	 		<p>They bonded over a shared affinity for working with raw, natural materials. They both valued making as a way to connect with the world, a curious hands-on exploration of how transforming matter can deepen our relationship with the surrounding territory. They also shared a fascination for archaic artefacts, narratives, and the imaginative journeys these objects and stories inspire.</p>
	 		<p>Drawing from their experience at Boisbuchet, where a temporary, self-organised community forms each season around making and exchange, they wanted to create a space that carried the same collective spirit of curiosity, experimentation, and mutual learning.</p>
	 		<p>Today, Apua is an open collective that has grown and evolved as new artists have joined, bringing their voices, inspirations, and imaginaries, leading to an experimental ground for further growth.</p>
